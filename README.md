# Virtual-Canvas
 This project is build with Python 3.8 and OpenCV 4.5. It detects the red color and draw according to its position.  
 Disclaimer: The program works fine but is a little bit noisy sometimes, it depends of the lights and color of the object you are using.

## How To Use 
  * Download the exe file and image (reload-icon.png) in same location.
  * Run the exe.
  * Use a red pen's cap or any other object of red color with nearly same area.
  * You are ready to draw. Press 's' if you want to save your drawing.
  * Press 'q' if you wanna exit.

 I'm open to suggestions or changes that you maybe have and want to provide.
